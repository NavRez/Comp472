# Comp472

# Prerequisites 
Makes sure to install the latest version of python (or at least 3.9) and install all of the aforementioned libraries : scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, panda ,gensim,matplotlib,codecs as well as any library outlined in the beginning of the file. This is NOT optional, they are all needed to ensure that the code is running appropriately.
The dataset used in this class is a very specific one, make sure that dataset is put in a txt file and called "all_sentiment_shuffled.txt" as it is spelt in the python file. Any typo will NOT work.

# Running the code
Make sure you have the latest version of VS Code and that you open a specific folder. Put the python code and the "all_sentiment_shuffled.txt" file in that folder. Make sure that VS Code is open at THAT specific folder or else the code will creash when attempting to search for the txt file. Once you have everything set, simply run the code.
The execution should take a few minutes and all three Models will be calculated along with the necessary plots.
